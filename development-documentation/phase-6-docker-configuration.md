# Phase 6: Docker and docker-compose Configuration

## Overview
In Phase 6, we've containerized the Djungle Contest API application using Docker and docker-compose, creating a portable, reproducible, and scalable deployment environment. We've implemented both development and production configurations to address different needs across the application lifecycle. Additionally, we fixed a critical issue with the logging system that prevented the application from starting properly.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Development Environment
- Created a **Dockerfile** for development that:
  - Uses Python 3.10 as the base image
  - Sets up appropriate environment variables
  - Installs necessary system dependencies
  - Provides a smooth development experience with live code reloading
- Developed a **docker-compose.yml** that orchestrates:
  - A Django web service with mounted volumes for real-time code changes
  - A Redis service for caching and potentially tracking win state
  - Shared volumes for static files, media files, and logs

### 2. Production Environment
- Created a **Dockerfile.prod** with:
  - Multi-stage build to minimize image size
  - Non-root user for improved security
  - Gunicorn as the production-grade WSGI server
- Designed a **docker-compose.prod.yml** that adds:
  - Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle static files and client connections
  - PostgreSQL as a production-grade database
  - Health checks for critical services
  - Enhanced security configurations

### 3. Entrypoint Scripts
- Developed **entrypoint.sh** for development:
  - Waits for dependent services to be ready
  - Applies database migrations automatically
  - Collects static files
  - Creates necessary log directories
- Created **entrypoint.prod.sh** for production:
  - Similar functionality but with production-specific considerations
  - Proper error handling and service dependency checks

### 4. Nginx Configuration
- Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy with:
  - Efficient static file serving with proper caching headers
  - WebSocket support
  - Security best practices
  - Proper header forwarding for the Django application

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Created **.env.prod.example** as a template for:
  - Django settings
  - Database configuration
  - Redis settings
  - Logging preferences
- Added **.dockerignore** to:
  - Reduce build context size
  - Exclude unnecessary files from images
  - Improve build performance

### 6. Logging System Fix
- Identified and fixed a critical logging issue that was causing application startup failures:
  - Added a `LoggingContextFilter` to provide default values for request-specific context variables
  - Applied the filter to handlers that use request-specific formatters
  - Created comprehensive documentation on logging troubleshooting in `documentation/logging_troubleshooting.md`
  - Ensured logging works correctly both within and outside request contexts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Development Setup

The development setup is designed for ease of use and fast iteration, with mounted volumes that reflect code changes instantly without requiring container rebuilds.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DEBUG=True
    depends_on:
      - redis
  
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
```

### Production Setup

The production setup focuses on security, scalability, and performance, using industry-standard components:

```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml (simplified)
version: '3.8'

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.25-alpine
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d
      - static_volume:/var/www/static
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.prod
    expose:
      - "8000"
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - db
  
  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    command: --requirepass ${REDIS_PASSWORD:-changeme}
```

### Multi-stage Dockerfile

The production Dockerfile uses multi-stage building to optimize the final image:

```Dockerfile
# First stage to build dependencies
FROM python:3.10-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip wheel --no-cache-dir --wheel-dir /app/wheels -r requirements.txt

# Final stage with only necessary components
FROM python:3.10-slim
COPY --from=builder /app/wheels /wheels
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir /wheels/*
USER app
CMD ["gunicorn", "djungle_contest_api.wsgi:application"]
```

## Challenges Addressed

### 1. Database Initialization
- Added wait mechanisms in entrypoint scripts to ensure database readiness
- Implemented automatic migrations to prepare the database schema

### 2. Static Files Management
- Configured volume mounting for development
- Set up Nginx to serve static files efficiently in production
- Automated collectstatic operations during container startup

### 3. Security Considerations
- Used non-root users in production containers
- Implemented password protection for Redis
- Separated environment variables into .env files
- Used multi-stage builds to reduce attack surface

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Configured proper caching headers for static assets
- Set up volume mounts only where necessary
- Used Alpine-based images where possible to reduce image size
- Implemented proper connection handling in Nginx

## Testing and Verification

The Docker setup has been tested to verify:
- Proper container startup and intercommunication
- Correct handling of environment variables
- Static file serving functionality
- Database connections and migrations
- Redis connectivity
- Development workflow efficiency

## Next Steps and Recommendations

1. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Add GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipelines for automated testing and deployment
   - Implement automatic image building and tagging

2. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
   - Set up centralized logging with ELK stack or similar

3. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Implement container orchestration with Kubernetes for larger deployments
   - Add load balancing configuration

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Conduct container security scanning
   - Implement Docker content trust
   - Add runtime security monitoring

5. **Documentation**
   - Further enhance deployment documentation
   - Create troubleshooting guides

## Conclusion
